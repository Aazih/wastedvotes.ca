A quick and dirty overview of how to get the site up and running.

I have worked on this site via both LAMP in Linux and AMPPS in Windows. So the site requires

Apache 
MySQL
PHP
Drupal 5.2

Most recently this site has been tested with:

Apache 2.4.23
MySQL 5.6.31
PHP 5.5.38

DATABASE SETUP:

Create the following databases in MySQL
drupal
elections_dev (optional)
elections_test (optional)
elections_prod

Import the included drupal_*.sql file in the root of this project into the drupal databases
Import the included elections*sql file in the root of this project into the elections_* databases

DATABASE USER:

This version of the site has the assumption that it will be making use of the root user to access the website with the default password 'mysql'

Please consider changing this to your own created user that is given all access priviledges to the databases created in the DATABASE SETUP section.


CODE SETUP:

Install Drupal v5.2

Make the wastedvotes website available in your www directory.

Change the drupal/sites/settings.php file and the login.inc file in PHP to use the appropriate DATABASE user and password.

And it should just work! No guarantees!
