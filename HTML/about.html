<p>Hi, my name is Aamir Hussain. Thanks for visiting! Currently this site is very much a solo effort born out of the frustration I feel from having no affect on government even though I vote in every election that I can. Since it's not well known how many Canadians are in the exact same situation I decided to create this site to track exactly that.</p>
<p>Right now I have the results of the 2006 federal and the 2003 Ontario election on the site. I hope to add as many elections as possible as every election shows just how many votes are thrown away and just how many Canadians go unheard because of our election system.</p>

<p>Elections on the site:</p>
<ul><li>2006 Federal Election</li>
<li>2005 British Columbia Election</li>
<li>1981 - 2003 Ontario Election</li>
</ul>

<p>Election results are taken from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF='http://www.elections.ca'>Elections Canada</A>
<li><A HREF='http://www.electionsontario.on.ca/'>Elections Ontario</A>
<li><A HREF='http://www.elections.bc.ca/'>Elections BC</A>
</ul>
